<p>
Understanding how to implement secure remote access protocols will eb a major part as an information security professional.
</p>

<div id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Remote Access Architecture"><h3 id="Remote Access Architecture" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Remote Access Architecture">Remote Access Architecture</a></h3></div>

<p>
Does not make direct cabled or wireless connection to the network.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Remote access is implemented as a virtual private network (VPN)

<li>
Administering remote access involves the same tasks as administering the local network 

<li>
Additional complexity comes about because it can be more difficult to ensure the security of remote workstations and servers and there is greater opportunity for remote logins to be exploited

<li>
With VPN, secure tunnel is establisehd so that contents are kept private, even to ISP

</ul>
<p>
VPNs can be used to connects sites in order to connect two or more networks.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Configured to operate automatically

<li>
Exchange security info using whichever protocol the VPN is based on

<li>
Hosts at eahc site do not need to be configured wit hany information about the VPN

</ul>
<div id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Transport Layer Security VPN"><h3 id="Transport Layer Security VPN" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Transport Layer Security VPN">Transport Layer Security VPN</a></h3></div>

<p>
Point-to-point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) has been depreciated because they do not offer adequate security.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Transport layer security (TLS) and IPSec are now the preferred options for configuring VPN Access

</ul>
<li>
TLS VPN

<ul>
<li>
Referred to as an SSL VPN

<li>
Requries a remote access server listening on port 443

<li>
Client makes a connection to the server usign TLS

<li>
Creates encrypted tunnel for the user to submit authentication credentials

<li>
Once authenticated, VPN tunnels all communications for the lcoal network over the secure socket

<li>
OpenVPN is an open source example of TLS VPN

</ul>
<div id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Internet Protocol Security"><h3 id="Internet Protocol Security" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Internet Protocol Security">Internet Protocol Security</a></h3></div>

<p>
Where TLS works on an applation level, IPSec works at the network layer (layer 3) of the OSI model.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can provide both confidentiality, and integriy/anti-replay

<li>
Adds overhead to data communications

<li>
Can be used to secure communications on a local netowrk as a remote access protocol

<li>
Each host must be assigned a policy

<li>
Hosts must be able to match at least one matching securit ymethod for a connection to be established

</ul>
<p>
<span id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Internet Protocol Security-Authentication Header (AH)"></span><strong id="Authentication Header (AH)">Authentication Header (AH)</strong>
Performs a cryptographic hash on the whole packet, including IP header, plus a shared secret key, and add this HMAC in its ehader as an Integrity Check Value (ICV).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Recipient does the same thing, and if same value is derived, it has not been messed with

<li>
IP header fields in ICV means that the check will fail across NAT gateways, where the IP address is rewritten

<ul>
<li>
Concequently, not often used

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<span id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Internet Protocol Security-Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)"></span><strong id="Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)">Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP)</strong>
Provides confidentiality and/or authentication and integrity.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can be used to encrypt the packet rather than simply calculating an HMAC

<li>
Attaches three fields to the packet: header, trailer, and integrity check value.

<li>
Unlike AH, ESP excludes the IP header when calculating the ICV

</ul>
<div id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-IPSec Transport and Tunnel Modes"><h3 id="IPSec Transport and Tunnel Modes" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-IPSec Transport and Tunnel Modes">IPSec Transport and Tunnel Modes</a></h3></div>

<p>
IPSec can be used in two modes:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Transport Mode: secure communications between hosts on a private network (and end-to end implementation)

<ul>
<li>
When ESP is applied in transport mode, the IP header fo reach packet is not encrypted, just payload data

<li>
If AH used, provides integrity for the IP header

</ul>
<li>
Tunnel Mode: Used for communications between VPN gateways across an unsecure network (creating a VPN)

<ul>
<li>
Also referred to as a router implementation

<li>
Whole IP packed (header and payload) is encrypted and encapsulated as a datagram with a new IP header

<li>
No real use dcase in tunnel mode, as confidentiality will usually be required.

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Internet Key Exchange"><h3 id="Internet Key Exchange" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Internet Key Exchange">Internet Key Exchange</a></h3></div>

<p>
IPSEc encryption and hashing depend on a shared secret that must be communicated to both hosts and the hosts much confirm one another's identities.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Otherwise, the connection is vulnerable to MITM and spoofing attacks

<li>
Interned Key Exchange (IKE) protocol handles authentication and key exchange

<ul>
<li>
Referred to as Security Associations (SA)

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
IKE negotiations take place over two phases:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Establish identity of two hosts and Diffie-Hellman key agreement to create a secure channel. Two methods of authenticating hosts are commonly used:

<ul>
<li>
Digital certificates

<li>
Pre-shared key

</ul>
<li>
Use secure channel to establish what ciphers and key sizes will be used with AH and/or ESP in the IPSec session

</ol>
<div id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol and IKE V2"><h3 id="Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol and IKE V2" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol and IKE V2">Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol and IKE V2</a></h3></div>

<p>
First version of IKE did not rpovide simple means fo rclient user to authenticate to a remote network directory.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For remote access VPNs, combo of IPSec with Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is often used

</ul>
<p>
<span id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol and IKE V2-Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol/IPSec VPN"></span><strong id="Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol/IPSec VPN">Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol/IPSec VPN</strong>
Typically operates as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Client and VPN Gateway set up IPSec channel over internet, using PSK or certs.

<li>
Gateway uses L2TP to set up tunnel to exchange local network data encapsulated as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frames

<ul>
<li>
Adds overhead

</ul>
<li>
User authenticates over the PP session using EAP or CHAP

</ol>
<p>
<span id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol and IKE V2-IKE v2"></span><strong id="IKE v2">IKE v2</strong>
Has some features that have made the protocol popular for use as a standalone remote access VPN solution.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Support for EAP authentication methods.

<ul>
<li>
allows for user to authenticate against RADIUS, for example 

</ul>
<li>
Simplified connection set up

<ul>
<li>
Single 4 message setup mode, redusing bandwidth without compromising security

</ul>
<li>
Reliability

<ul>
<li>
NAT traversal and MOBIKE multihoming

<ul>
<li>
Multihoming refers to when a client can keep IPSec switching between multiple network interfaces

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
IKE v2 is more efficient that IPSec, and is much mor supported.
</p>

<div id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-VPN Client Configuration"><h3 id="VPN Client Configuration" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-VPN Client Configuration">VPN Client Configuration</a></h3></div>

<p>
Client software needed for non OS-Supported VPNs.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Topic 11C: Implement Secure Remote Access Protocols-VPN Client Configuration-Always on VPN"></span><strong id="Always on VPN">Always on VPN</strong>
Computer establishes the VPN whenever an internet connection over a trusted network is detected.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Uses cache to authenticate

</ul>
