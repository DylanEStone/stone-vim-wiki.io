<ul>
<li>
The senders private key. (incorrect)

<li>
The recipient's public key (principally). The public key is used to encryp a symmetric session key and (for performance reasons) the session key does the actual data encoding. The session key and, therefor, the message text can then only be recovered by the recipient, who uses the linked private key to decrypt it. <span class="todo">TODO</span> Review
