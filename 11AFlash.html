<ul>
<li>
If the DSN service is breached, it could lead to company leaks, user data leaks, man in the middle attacks, spoofing. All of which can lower the reputation of the company.

<li>
Denial of service.

False. HOSTS file is still usually checked first.

<div id="What is DNS server cache poisoning?"><h1 id="What is DNS server cache poisoning?" class="header"><a href="#What is DNS server cache poisoning?">What is DNS server cache poisoning?</a></h1></div>

<ul>
<li>
When a DNS table is given false routing information that will usually lead users of the DNS to some sort of malware.

When the server cache is overritten with malicious routing.

<ul>
<li>
SASL uses signing?? I really don't know.

<li>
The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) allows a choice of authentication providers and encryption (sealing)/integrity signing) mechanisms. By contrast, LDAPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt traffic, but users still authenticate via simply binding. Also, SASL is the standards-based meands of configuring LDAP security.

<ul>
<li>
You should ensure it is updated, use hard to guess names, never send the unencrypted string or something.

<li>
Configure strong community names and use access control lists to restrict management operations to known hosts.
