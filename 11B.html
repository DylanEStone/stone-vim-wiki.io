<p>
Switches, routers, access points, and secure hosts are implemented for running services.
Application protocols that enable web, email and VoIP requrie secure configuration too.
</p>

<div id="Topic 11B: Implementing Secure Application Protocols-Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Web Services"><h2 id="Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Web Services" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11B: Implementing Secure Application Protocols-Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Web Services">Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Web Services</a></h2></div>

<p>
Foundation of web technology is the HTTP. HTTP enables browsers to request resources from an HTTP server.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Client connects using appropriate TCP port (default 80)

<li>
Submits request for resource usign URL

<li>
Server acknowledges the request and responds with data.

</ul>
<p>
The response and request payload formats are defined in an HTTP header. 
</p>

<p>
HTTP uses a forms mechanism (POST) where a user can submit data from the client to the server.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
HTTP Nominally stateless protocol meaning no info about the client during a session.

<li>
Basic functionality is extended by scripting and programmable features.

<li>
Servers can set text file cookies to preserve session info

</ul>
<p>
These features, plus integration with databases increase flexibility and interactivity, but also increase the attack surface which exposes vulnerabilities.
</p>

<div id="Topic 11B: Implementing Secure Application Protocols-Transport Layer Security"><h2 id="Transport Layer Security" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11B: Implementing Secure Application Protocols-Transport Layer Security">Transport Layer Security</a></h2></div>

<p>
HTTP is not secured. SSL was developed by Netscape in the 90's to address this lack of security.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
SSL quickly adopted as a standard  named Transport Layer Security (TLS)

</ul>
<p>
HTTPS = HTTP + SSL
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can also be used to secure other application protocols and as virtual private networking (VPN) solution.

<li>
Can also install cert on client so server can trust client (More for VPN)

</ul>
<p>
<span id="Topic 11B: Implementing Secure Application Protocols-Transport Layer Security-SSL/TLS Versions"></span><strong id="SSL/TLS Versions">SSL/TLS Versions</strong>
With SSL, the TLS versions are the only ones that are safe to use.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Support for legacy clients is possible but less secure.

</ul>
<p>
TLS v 1.3 features the removval of the ability to perform downgrade attacks by preventing the use of unsecure features and algorithms from previous versions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Also changes to the handshake to reduce number of messages and speed connections.

</ul>
<p>
<span id="Topic 11B: Implementing Secure Application Protocols-Transport Layer Security-Cipher Suites"></span><strong id="Cipher Suites">Cipher Suites</strong>
Group of algorithms supported by both client and server to perform different encryption and hashing operations.
</p>

<p>
Would be written in the following form:
</p>

<p>
  ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
</p>
  
<ul>
<li>
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral mode for session key agreement.

<li>
RSA signatures, 128 bit AES-GCM (Galois Counter Mode) for symmetric bulk encryption

<li>
256-bit SHA for HMAC functions

</ul>
<p>
TLS 1.3 uses shortened suites. Would appear as follows:
</p>

<p>
  TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
</p>
  
<ul>
<li>
Only ephemeral key agreement is supported in 1.3

<li>
Signature type is supplied in the certificate

<li>
SHA384 used within the new hash key derivation function (HKDF)

<ul>
<li>
Mechanism by which the shared secret established by Diffie Hellman key agreement is used to derive symmetric session keys

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Topic 11B: Implementing Secure Application Protocols-API Considerations"><h2 id="API Considerations" class="header"><a href="#Topic 11B: Implementing Secure Application Protocols-API Considerations">API Considerations</a></h2></div>

<p>
Primary means of configuring and managing a web application is via its <span id="Topic 11B: Implementing Secure Application Protocols-API Considerations-application programming interface (API)"></span><strong id="application programming interface (API)">application programming interface (API)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://example.foo/api/users?api_key=123456">https://example.foo/api/users?api_key=123456</a>
</p>
  
<p>
The developer usees the POST method to submit data to the URL with the required parameters coded into the request body, often in JSON
</p>

<pre>
  POST /api/users HTTP/1.1
  
  Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "user": {
      "name": "James",
      "email": "jpengelly@comptia.org"
    }
  }
</pre>
  
<p>
Effective management of these API secrets is an essential consideration in modern networks
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They have been widely used to perpetuate various breaches and data thefts

<li>
For example, putting the key in the URL carries a severe risk of exposure.

<li>
Can use SAML and OAuth, but still come with secrets management requirements.

<li>
Should be monitored to ensure only authorized endpoints are making transactions.

</ul>
